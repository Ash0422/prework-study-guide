# Webpage for Prework Study Guide

## Description

Starting this prework study makes me release that I don't know anything about coding, I tried to give up a few times but there was something deep inside me keeps saying don't give up, no one was born with knowledge, they start from zero and they never gave up. Seeing all those people on social media talking about how fun it is to be a developer and showing their great work made me move on and forget about giving up.

I want to learn to code and be a developer so I start building this project to help me understand the basics and have an idea of how to create a website.

This project solves my big problem and it answers the most popular question of what coding language should I  start learning first.

Honestly, I learned a lot from this project by using commands in git bash to understand how coding works to create a webpage, fix bugs in the code, and finally how each coding language supports the other.
